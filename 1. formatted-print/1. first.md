##### Printing is handled by a series of macros defined in std::fmt some of which include:
          format!: write formatted text to String
          print!: same as format! but the text is printed to the console (io::stdout).
          println!: same as print! but a newline is appended.
          eprint!: same as format! but the text is printed to the standard error (io::stderr).
          eprintln!: sames as eprint!but a newline is appended.


##### example for format!
          fn main() {    
            let language = format!("{}","rust"); 
            eprintln!("programming language : {}",language);    
          }
          
          
##### positional arguments
          println!("{0}, this is {1}. {1}, this is {0}", "Alice", "Bob");
          //Alice, this is Bob. Bob, this is Alice
          
          
##### named arguments.
          println!("{subject} {verb} {object}",
                       object="the lazy dog",
                       subject="the quick brown fox",
                       verb="jumps over");
          //output : the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog          
          
          
##### decimal to binary
          println!("{} of {:b} people know binary, the other half doesn't", 1, 2);
          //output : 1 of 10 people know binary, the other half doesn't
          //decimal 2 is 10 in binary
